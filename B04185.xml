            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>KNowledge is one great accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rational creature: Of all Knowledge, there is none ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing as that which is Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: Of all Divine Knowledge, the Knowledge of God, and his perfections, is the moſt excellent: Of all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God, there is none ſo ſweet and deſirable to be known, as this of his Love: This was the Element in which this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle and beloved Diſciple St. <hi>John</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and it made ſuch impreſſions upon his heart, that he breaths little but love throughout this Epiſtle, and makes known ſomething of what he had experience of in his own Soul; and not only declares the love of God, but aſſerts God himſelf to be love, in the Text now before us: Which words are a ſhort deſcription of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175722:5"/>God, and a Propoſition in themſelves and ſo let us take them.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That God is Love.</hi> 'Tis more eaſie to declare what God is not than what he is; hence ſome chuſe to ſpeak of him <hi>viâ remotionis;</hi> they conſider the imperfections which are in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and remove them all from God as inconſiſtent with a Deity: Thus they ſay he is impeccable, impaſſible, immortal and the like; becauſe to ſin, to ſuffer, to die, are imperfections in the creature This gives a negative diſcovery of him but falls far ſhort of what he is. The holy Scriptures give us the moſt poſitive account of him, yet not according to his infinite perfections, no words can do that, but ſo as is moſt ſuitable to his nature, and our apprehenſions.<note place="margin">John 4.24. 1 John 1.5.</note> Thus we read that God is a Spirit; God is Light; and God is Love: Thus he is twice ſtiled in this Chapter; <hi>viz.</hi> in the 8th verſe of it, and in the Text.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175722:5"/>his Nature. Creatures may be loving, God only is Love. In creatures it is but an accident or quality, in God it is of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſcent, of his ſubſtance and being. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God is Love.</hi> Even as the Sun hath but one glorious brightneſs, &amp; no colours, yet makes all other colours viſible: So, though many things may help our apprehenſions of God, (we call him juſt when he puniſheth, true when he performs his promiſes, merciful and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving when he ſhews pity to them in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,) yet God is but one entire perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>Quicquid in Deo, Deus eſt;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in God, is God.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>The Head and Eyes are the higheſt members, to guide and govern the reſt that are inferiour, and the loweſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the higheſt, and in the midſt the hands to defend and maintain them all: But moſt eminently is God's Love ſeen in the faculties of man's Soul, in which he hath ſet up his Image, and Ingraven his own likeneſs; How beautiful was man in the day of his Creation? There are 3 noble faculties, underſtanding, will, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet but one Soul, which ſome judge to be a ſhadow of God, where there is a Trinity of Perſons in an unity of eſſence: Others ſay the underſtanding repreſents God's Omniſcience: He knows all things; <hi>And ye have an unction from the Holy One,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.20.</note> ſaith St. <hi>John, and know all things.</hi> In the will there is a ſhadow of God's Freedom and Soveraignty; God is a free Agent, ſo is man's will, it hath a natural freedom to chuſe and refuſe.

If no more be ſaid, theſe things declare God's Love to Man in his original frame and conſtitution: Yet the proviſions God has made both for Body and Soul, ſpeak this more fully; for the Body he hath provided food, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reſt: The day for man to work in, and the night to reſt in: For the Soul, Arts and Sciences: He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all men the Book of the Creatures to read, and many good Leſſons may be learned out of them;<note place="margin">Pſal 19.1.</note>

A man is known by his ſpeech, as a veſſel when we knock it is known to be full or empty.

                  <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. And Chriſt came and died in our nature for the world of Mankind, and not for the lapſed Angels: Which of the Angels can ſay, <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given?</hi> He took not on him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The good Angels need no pardon, the bad Angels are excluded from it, and Man only hath a Saviour provided for him, and offered to him in the Goſpel upon terms highly juſt, equal and reaſonable.

                  <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> If men refuſe and reject the tenders of Salvation, as the moſt do, their deſtruction is of themſelves; and the Love of God appears more in ſaying the remnant that believe, than any ſeverity in deſtroying the reſt; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, he is not the cauſe of their ſin, but is grieved that they will not accept Life upon Goſpel-terms. This is evident in his weeping over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">Luk. 19 42.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou at least in this thy day hadst known the things that belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> So that every mans deſtruction is of himſelf,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.9. Joh. 5.40. Heb. 2.3.</note> becauſe men will not come to Chriſt that they might have Life, but refuſe him that ſpeaks from Heaven, and neglect great Salvation. This
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:175722:12"/>is written in legible Characters, that he that runs may read the Love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards degenerate, fallen Man. That's the ſecond declaration of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us look upon Man in his actual and effectual Recovery and Reſtitution; and here we ſhall ſee yet further and more eminent manifeſtations of God's Love unto thoſe that are his own in the World: He hath declared greatly his Love to all Mankind, yet much higher Love is in him to all true Chriſtians. 'Tis ſaid, Chriſt looked upon the young man in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> and loved him. We alſo find it recorded, that he loved <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lazarus:</hi> Of this laſt, they went to Jeſus and ſaid, <hi>Behold, he whom thou lovest is ſick?</hi> and this was ſuch,<note place="margin">John 11.3, 5, 36.</note> as others obſerved it: For Jeſus weeping at his grave, they ſaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him.</hi> And I doubt not but it was a far higher and more endeared Love, than what he had for the young man; who, it's evident, loved the World more than Chriſt, and eſteemed earthly Treaſure above heavenly. To make this Love of God more apparent, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Properties thereof. This Love is great, comprehenſive, free, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, excellent, ſatisfying and everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a great and tranſcendent Love
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:175722:12"/>which God hath declared unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>God, who is rich in mercy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.4.</note> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, for the great love wherewith he loved us.</hi> He is a great God, and his Love is like himſelf, a great Love: 'Tis great above humane expreſſions, yet ſome can ſpeak great words. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in his Viſions, he was caught up into Heaven,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> and heard things unutterable. We read of joy unſpeakable;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> ſuch is the Love of God to his Servants, the beſt and greateſt words are too weak to declare it; yea, it's greater than the largeſt apprehenſions of Men and Angels can reach. This Love of God is like the Peace of God,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7.</note> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, paſſeth all underſtanding. Hence we find that the four dimenſions, by which men take an eſtimate of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real greatneſs, are given to this Love. We read of the breadth, and length,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.18, 19.</note> and height, and depth of this Love; the very ſame which are aſcribed to God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the greatneſs of his perfection; which is ſaid to be as high as Heaven,<note place="margin">Job 11.7, 8, 9.</note> deeper than Hell, longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea: But I would ſpeak of it comparatively, and ſo amplifie the greatneſs of this Love. The Love of one creature to another is very great: That between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> was great,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.26.</note>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:175722:13"/>and wonderful, even paſſing the Love of Women; either of one Woman to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of an affectionate Mother to her only Son, or of a loving Wife to her deareſt Husband: But what is <hi>David</hi>'s Love, or the Love of all creatures to God's Love? The one is but finite, the other infinite: Compare it with the Love of good men unto God; ſome have had great affections this way; as <hi>David, I love thee dearly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.1.</note> ſays he, <hi>O Lord, my ſtrength:</hi> But here is a vaſt diſproportion: If all the Love that ever have been, now is, and ever ſhall be in all the Saints, were in one mans heart, it would be a great Love to God, yet far ſhort of that in God to them. Let us compare it with the Love of God to other objects; he loves all his creatures, as ſuch; yet Man above all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour creatures: The Angels by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had more Love than Man; and he loves Chriſt yet more than all. Now his Love to his People is greater than all theſe, except the laſt; and though Chriſt is the more adaequate object of God's Love, and ſo hath higher meaſures of it than Believers are capable of, yet he loves them with the ſame Love for quality and kind, that he loves Chriſt with. This we learn from Chriſt himſelf in his ſolemn
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:175722:13"/>Prayer, That the Love wherewith his Father hath loved him, may be in them. And again,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.23, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>That the world may know that thou hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</hi> Every Beam of Light is of the ſame kind with that in the Sun; every drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the ſame for quality with that in the Ocean; and ſo every drop of that Love which falls upon Believers, is the ſame for kind and nature with what the Father bears to his Son: Oh the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent greatneſs of his Love! Who is not amazed at it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a comprehenſive Love; it includes all the kinds or acts of Love whatſoever: The Sun is ſo glorious a Light, becauſe in the light thereof, all other lights are contained in an eminent manner. Thus it is in this Love of God to his People, there are all acts of Love in it; there is <hi>amor benevolentiae,</hi> the Love of good will; there is <hi>amor miſerecordiae,</hi> a Love of pity and compaſſion:<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> 
                  <hi>In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.</hi> This Love inclines him to ſuccour them in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and to help them in trouble: There is alſo <hi>amor amicitiae,</hi> the Love of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which he manifeſteth to them as they come to cloſe with him in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.8.</note>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:175722:14"/>ſaith the Lord to <hi>Iſrael, and thou becamest mine, and this was the time of Love.</hi> This is reconciling Love, which is nothing but a redintegration, or renewing of broken friendſhip between God and us: Sin makes the breach, and God's Love makes it up: Hence comes <hi>Abraham</hi> a Heathen and an Enemy, to be called the Friend of God:<note place="margin">James 2. Rom. 5.8, 10.</note> Herein has God commended his Love, that his People, when Enemies, were reconciled by the death of his Son. Into ſuch friendſhip hath this Love brought them, as the ſecrets of God are revealed to them: <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, ſays God,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.17.</note> 
                  <hi>the thing that I will do?</hi> Thus Chriſt called his Diſciples Friends; For,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.15.</note> ſays he, <hi>Whatſoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> There is alſo <hi>amor beneficentiae,</hi> the Love of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficience; his heart opens his hand to do them good, even beyond all the good of this World. He loves them, therefore he gives his Son for them,<note place="margin">1 John 4.9.</note> and to them, and into them, that he may live in them, and they live through him. It is this Love that gives them the remiſſion of their ſins: <hi>He hath loved them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and waſhed them from their ſins in his own blood:</hi> 'Tis this Love that confers Adopting grace: <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed</hi>

                  <hi>upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> It is this Love that moves him to comfort them: <hi>He hath loved us,</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Paul, and given us everlaſting conſolation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.16.</note> If not alwaies the ſenſe of comfort, yet firm and ſure grounds of ſtrong and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſolation: Once more, There is alſo <hi>amor complacentiae,</hi> a Love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and delight God hath in his People, which is the higheſt act or degree of Love: All his delight is in his Saints,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> that are in the earth: His Truth, his Worſhip, and his People are all he hath any great delight in here in this World: To a contrite Chriſtian, that trembles at his word,<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.</note> he looks with an eye of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complacency, than to Heaven and Earth.

               <p>THat theſe words have relation to the foregoing paſſages is evident, by the particle <hi>(For)</hi> in the beginning of them. Some think the Apoſtle reaſſumes the Argument he had hinted at in the 5th <hi>v.</hi> in a Parentheſis, <hi>By grace ye are ſaved,</hi> and ſo gives a more full explication of them. Others refer them to what is ſpoken in the 7th <hi>verſe,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſhews the end God had in the application of Salvation to theſe <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who were Gentiles, which was, that in the Ages to come he might ſhew forth the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches of his grace in his kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then adds the words of the Text as a reaſon thereof; <hi>For by grace are ye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> as if he had ſaid, God hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered it thus towards you, that it

But let us remember, that though ſalvation be not of good works, yet they ought to be done, becauſe it is the will of God we ſhould be zealous of good works, (<hi>Titus</hi> 2.14.) We are created in Chriſt unto good works, which God ordained we ſhould walk in them. They that have believed in God, ſhould be careful to maintain good works.

               <p>Here I might aſſign Reaſons why ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of grace: I will name but one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is hinted at here; namely, to exclude boaſting, that no fleſh may glory in God's preſence. <hi>Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; that all

When

Some cannot endure to hear of the ſinfulneſs of their good works, of the raggedneſs of their own beſt Righteouſneſs: Thus did the Phariſees, they could not endure Chriſt ſhould pull up the Bridge upon which they hoped to go to Heaven; theſe think to be ſaved by their good works; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we ſhould ſay, We ſerve God, becauſe his free and rich grace invites; and though imperfections cleave to our works, yet we expect not ſalvation by them, but we appeal to the rich and free love and grace of God to ſave us.

A man may as ſoon think to get over a deep River upon the ſhadow of a Tree that grows by it, as get to Heaven by his good works: This very thought mars and poiſons all; if thou thinkeſt to be ſaved by them, it is very doubtful whether thou doſt not run the very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of thy ſalvation, be thy doings never ſo good. The Goſpel is a Doctrine of the utmoſt ſelf-denial; it draws men to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:175722:40"/>good works in reſpect of performance and then draws them off from good works in regard of dependance. O th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thus faith is the Nurſe of all graces drawing ſap from Chriſt the root, and deriving influence from the Spirit to keep
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:175722:43"/>them in life and activity. In a word, it gives victory over temptations, outward from the world, alluring or affrighting, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4.) <hi>This is the victory whereby we overcome the world, even our faith:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Satan: By this ſhield of faith we may be able to quench all the fiery darts of that wicked one, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16.)

If any further enquire, How the way of faith is conſiſtent with grace? I anſwer; Very well, as appears by what is ſaid, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.) <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace:</hi> For there is no grace ſo modeſt and humble, that arrogates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it ſelf, but gives all to grace, as faith is and doth. Faith ſaves in a way of grace, a precarious way: It is empty and poor, hath nothing of it ſelf, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all from grace, and gives all again unto grace; ſo that no way could have been found out more advantageous to the glory and honour of grace, than this of faith.

Men had rather periſh juſtly, than be ſaved freely: They will rather run the hazard of eternal ruine, than be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to Chriſt to ſave them.

It is willing to lay the ſtreſs of its ſalvation upon Chriſt alone, though it hath but a bare word to reſt upon, and to take Chriſt upon his own terms in the execution of all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, though it be contrary to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a natural condition. <hi>I will work,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and who ſhall let it?</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13.)

                  <item>3. He provides food and raiment for them: I ſay, food both for their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Souls. So he did for <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, as the text ſhews. He fed them in the Wilderneſs with Manna. What the Manna was we read, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 6. largely.) It was the bread that the Lord gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Clouds to eat. There was no plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſowing in the Wilderneſs, and ſo no ordinary proviſion; God therefore gave them Manna miraculouſly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily; They did eat Angels food, ſaies the Pſalmiſt; Excellent food it was, if Angles needed, they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no better. Thus wonderfully did he ſeed <hi>Iſrael</hi> forty years together in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:175722:64"/>Wilderneſs. And this was not food on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their Bodies, but for their Souls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Hence it is ſaid to be Spiritual meat, in that place beforenamed, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) <hi>They did all eat the ſame Spiritual meat:</hi> Becauſe the Manna was an eminent Type of Chriſt, as is largely ſet forth by Chriſt himſelf, (<hi>John</hi> 6.) It was one of the Jews extraordinary Sacraments, which ſealed up to Believers their Spiritual nouriſhment in grace by the free Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God in the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> He alſo ſecured their Cloths from waxing old by a miracle. And he is not worſe to his Goſpel-Church than to <hi>Iſreal.</hi> There is a general care God hath of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; He feeds the Ravens when they cry unto him: He gives all his Creatures their meat in due ſeaſon; He opens his hands, and ſatisfies the deſire of every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing: (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.15, 16.) There is a more particular care he takes of man, but yet exerciſeth a more ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar providence over his Church and People. So he provided for <hi>David</hi> in his ſtraits: He ſent a Raven with bread and fleſh morning and evening to feed <hi>Elijah,</hi> (1. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4, 6.) And in the ſame Chapter we read how wonderfully he provided for the widow of <hi>Zarephath;</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:175722:64"/>when ſhe had but a handfull of meal in the barrel, and a little oil in the cruiſe; he by a miracle increaſed it, ſo that it fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not till God ſent rain on the earth. So Chriſt miraculouſly multipled the loaves that he might feed the People in the Wilderneſs, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 15.) And as for the bodies, ſo for the Souls of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he ſtill feeds them in all their ſtraits. If the ordinary means of grace fail he can provide extraordinarily. Hence it is ſaid, God had prepared that they, (namely, the two Prophets ſpoken of, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.) ſhould feed the Woman in the Wilderneſs, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, 14.) They ſhould feed thoſe hidden ones with the hidden Manna. So he promiſeth to feed his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the heritage of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> their Father, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14.) that is, with ſpiritual communications of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And again, (<hi>Zech.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>I will feed the flock of ſlaughter, even you O poor of the flock.</hi> An afflicted and poor people, deſigned to ſlaughter and ruine; who have loſt your viſible paſtures, the Ordinances: I will be your Shepherd; and will feed you inviſibly by my Word and Spirit, ye ſhall go in and out and find paſtures.

Wings do both ſhelter and refreſh in a Scorching time or time of danger. Thus doth a Rock alſo. Thus God hath Wings and is a Rock in theſe caſes, to give ſhelter and to cheriſh in all troubles outward and ſpiritual. And thus hath the Scripture ſet him forth, &amp; good men found him in all their ſtraits and needs. See <hi>Davids</hi> experience of him and carriage towards him, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.7.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2.) <hi>O thou that ſaveſt them that truſt in thee, hide me under the Shadow of thy Wings. In the Shadow of thy Wings
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:175722:93"/>will I make my refuge, untill theſe Calamities be overpaſt,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1.) <hi>The Lord is my Rock, and my fortreſs, and my deliverer, my God, my ſtrength in whom I will truſt,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7.8. <hi>The Children of men ſhall put their truſt under the Shadow of thy Wings they ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe,</hi> &amp;c. The Rock gave ſupply to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the thirſty Wilderneſs, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15.) And that Rock was Chriſt ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.) So then, when in the ſenſe of Soul miſeries, as of guilt or temptations, we betake our ſelves to God in Chriſt, flee for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us, and to that grace that is ſufficient for us; When in outward dangers we run into the name of the Lord as our ſtrong hold, then we are ſaid to truſt in him.

But it is meant of a knowledge with affection and approbation. So he knoweth them that truſt in him, therefore he hath in the Scripture pronounced them bleſſed, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thee.</hi> Yea this implies, that he will own and acknowledge them, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and manifeſt unto others that they are his people, (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.2.) <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Not as his creatures only, as he knows all the beaſts of the field, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.11.) but as his Children.

Hence he is ſaid, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8.) To be the <hi>ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever. Yeſterday,</hi> viz. To them under the Law, <hi>To day,</hi> viz.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As he is oppoſed to a threefold darkneſs, ſo he is a light in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a darkneſs of miſery, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.22.) <hi>They ſhall look to the Earth, and behold trouble and darkneſs, dimneſs of anguiſh, and they ſhall be driven to darkneſs.</hi> It is ſpoken of the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who finding no help from heaven, turn their eyes downward, looking hither and thither for comfort, but in ſtead thereof, meet with nothing but darkneſs, are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to darkneſs; that is, to variety, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and continuance of miſery. Hell is called <hi>outer darkneſs,</hi> becauſe of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, miſery, and diſcomfort to them
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:175722:100"/>there. In oppoſition to this is the <hi>light of joy and gladneſs.</hi> The Jews had light and gladneſs, joy and honour, (<hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.16.) <hi>Light is ſowen for the Righteous, and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the upright in heart,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11.) Light and gladneſs here are the ſame; the reaſon why light is put for gladneſs, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe light is pleaſant, and diſpoſeth a man to joy, whereas darkneſs inclines a man to ſadneſs: <hi>Light is ſweet,</hi> ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> (<hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>And a pleaſant thing it is to the eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> Thus Chriſt is light, for he gives the trueſt ground of Joy, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>The people that walked in darkneſs, have ſeen a great light; they that dwell in the Land of the Shadow of death, upon them hath the light ſhined.</hi> This prophecy is applyed to the coming of Chriſt, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16.) and then ſaid to be in part fulfilled. The meaning is plain. The people of God, <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> walking in the darkneſs of miſery and calamity, ſhall ſee that light at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which will glad and rejoice their hearts. Therefore we read that the news of his Incarnation is ſaid to be tidings of great Joy, (<hi>Luke</hi> 2.10.) <hi>And when Chriſt was preached by</hi> Philip <hi>in</hi> Samaria <hi>there was great Joy in that City,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.5, 8.) Hence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:175722:101"/>
                  <hi>the preaching of the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.19.) Not as if Chriſt preached but one year, as ſome think, (for he preached more than one or two years,) but it is an alluſion to the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> which was a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe proclaimed by ſound of Trumpet to them that would go free, which could not but be matter of Joy to many: So this is the happy time of Gods grace, wherein the welcom news of the Goſpel is proclaimed, wherein men may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Chriſt, if they come in unto him; They ſhall be ſet free by the Son, and then they are free indeed, free from the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the Law, and ſo from the fear of condemnation. This is the good will of God in Chriſt to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and tidings of great Joy to all that truly receive Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel; Thus Chriſt is light in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the darkneſs of trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the darkneſs of ſin and wickedneſs: <hi>What communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.) Gracious perſons with wicked Idolaters in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or other intimate fellowſhip: <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with God, and walk in darkneſs,</hi> that is, in ſin and ungodlineſs,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:175722:101"/>
                  <hi>we lie, and the truth is not in us,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6.) And we are exhorted to <hi>put off the deeds of darkneſs,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12.) <hi>And to have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11.) Which works are ſet down in the third and fourth verſes of the Chapter. <hi>But fornication, and uncleaneſs, and covetouſneſs, let it not be once named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you as becometh Saints.</hi> In oppoſition to this is the light of holineſs, and true converſion. Hence when men are ſaid to be turned from Satan to God, it is ſet out by their being turned from darkneſs to light, (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.18.) And by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſlated from the power of darkneſs, (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.13, 14.) And the Church is ſaid to be clothed with the Sun, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1.) Thus is Chriſt the light, (1.) For his whiteneſs, and this relates to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Juſtification. Light is white, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2.) When Chriſt was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, his raiment was white as the light. Chriſt is light, he is clothed, and clothes his Saints with white Garments, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4.) They are ſaid to walk with Chriſt in White, and to have waſhed their Robs, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14.) In this ſenſe are believers all fair and no ſpot in them, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7.) Light is of ſo undefileable
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:175722:102"/>a nature, that nothing can pollute it; It ſhines into the moſt naſty and filthy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and contracts no defilement. And ſuch are theſe garments of Juſtifying righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs with which he inveſteth his Church and people. (2.) For direction. Light directs us how to walk and keep our way, and keeps from ſtumbling and falling into danger: <hi>If any man walk in the day he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this World,</hi> (John 11.9.) <hi>But if a man walk in the night he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him.</hi> This relates to the righteouſneſs of ſanctification, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. <hi>v.</hi> 3.) <hi>O ſend out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me.</hi> Light guides the traveller in his way. Men in the dark loſe their way, and go they know not whither, as the Text we are upon ſpeaks: Think they are going to heaven, when indeed it is to Hell that they are going; <hi>The way of the wicked is as darkneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 4.19.) <hi>They know not at what they ſtumble.</hi> Thoſe men ſtricken with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.) thought they had been going to <hi>Dotham,</hi> but when their eyes were opened, behold, they were in the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> their enemies Country. Thus men think of going to paradiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in the dark, and if the Lord
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:175722:102"/>be not gracious to open their eyes in time, they go into outer darkneſs. Now Chriſt is the light to lead the blind in the way they know not, and hath promiſed to do it, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.16.) <hi>I will bring the blind by away they know not, and lead them in paths that they have not known; I will make dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs light before them,</hi> &amp;c. This is he that leads Souls in the way of righteouſneſs, in the midſt of the paths of Judgment, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8.20.) And the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks the ſame; (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.3.) <hi>He leadeth in the paths of Righteouſneſs for his names ſake.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed the Pillar in the Wilderneſs, they took no harm. When <hi>Peter</hi> kept neer the light, followed Chriſt cloſe, he ſtumbled not, but leaving Chriſt, he daſhed himſelf againſt a ſtone, and ſadly bruiſed himſelf. Good <hi>Joſiah</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the night in that raſh expedition againſt <hi>Pharaoh-Necho;</hi> He went up to the Battel not ſo much as asking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, and loſt his life. Chriſt is the only light to guide our feet into the way of peace, as he leads in the way of holineſs in which way-faring men, though fools, err not.</p>

Hence when he comes, he is ſaid to give the knowledge of ſalvation unto his people, by the remiſſion of their ſins, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.77.) And the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is ſeen only in the face of Chriſt, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) More particularly; He ſheweth two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of light. (1.) As he makes things manifeſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. <hi>All things that are reproved are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the light, for whatſoever doth make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt is light.</hi> Thus doth Chriſt diſcover the glorious things of God; His bleſſed attributes, the freeneſs of his grace,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:175722:104"/>the riches of his mercy, his infinite truth, power, wiſdom, Juſtice, and goodneſs. He diſcovers the depth of <hi>Satan,</hi> the myſteries of iniquity by which he works, the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and turnings of this old crooked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the wiles, devices, and methods of this ſubtil &amp; deceitful adverſary. <hi>We are not ignorant of his devices,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11.) Thanks be to Chriſt, the true light, for the knowledge of them. He alſo makes manifeſt the hidden Counſels of mens hearts. He ſhews what our natures are and what our conditions are, whether good or bad, pleaſing to God or no. (2.) He enlightens the Soul to apprehend theſe things, for it is blind, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.18.) <hi>Look ye blind, that ye may ſee.</hi> For though we have eyes, yet we are blind, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee; <hi>Who is blind but my Servant?</hi> As the next words are.

Chriſtleſs Souls, if ſenſible of their condition, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fearleſs Souls.

Fears leſt death ſurprize them, leſt their hearts ruine them, leſt <hi>Satan</hi> devoure them, leſt the Juſtice of God overtake them. They riſe up in fear, and lye down in fear, they go out and come in under many fears; they work out their Salvation with fear and trembling.

We read, (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.3.) That as <hi>Saul</hi> journied and came neer <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>aſcus,</hi> ſuddenly there ſhined round about him a light from heaven. This was ſome beams of glory from the glorified body of the Lord Jeſus, for it is ſaid to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the brightneſs of the Sun, (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.13.) If ſtill you ſay, may not a falſe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:175722:107"/>light pretend to be from heaven? Are not ſuch pretences frequently made by thoſe who hold forth new lights? How ſhall we then certainly know the light which is indeed from heaven, from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to it? There are three Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, or three effects of this light which ſhined from heaven upon <hi>Saul,</hi> ſet down in the 4th, 5th, and 6th verſes of this 9th Chap. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> which will be found upon others alſo in ſome meaſure upon whom Chriſt this true Light ſhines ſavingly.
<list>
                     <item>(1.) It is a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling light. This was the firſt effect it had upon <hi>Saul,</hi> verſe 4. He fell to the earth; not only proſtrate in his body, but doubtleſs his heart was low, laid in the duſt even at the foot of Chriſt. Hath the light we received had this bleſſed effect upon us, to humble us for the pride of our heart? Doth it puff us up, and make us proud, conceited of our ſelves, deſpiſers of others: This light is the work of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, transforming himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light. The light from heaven brought <hi>Saul</hi> into a poſture of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who before thought ſcorn to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled; and will have the ſame effect upon our hearts.</item>
                     <item>(2.) It made <hi>Saul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:175722:107"/>after Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>He ſaid, Who art thou Lord?</hi> By which queſtion, he acknowledgeth his own ignorance, and miſtake, and begs information and inſtruction in the knowledge of Chriſt. Such operation will the light that comes indeed from Heaven have upon us. It will make us full of enquiries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt. Such as theſe; <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> How ſhall I know thee? Where ſhall I find thee? How ſhall I come to be acquainted with thee, O thou bleſſed Lord Jeſus? How may I get ſome experimental knowledge of thee in the vertues of thy death, in the power of thy reſurrection, in the influences of thy grace and Spirit, in the comforts of thy love and covenant?</item>
                     <item>(3.) It cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Saul</hi> to ſubmit himſelf to Chriſt, his will to Chriſts commands, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. He ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have gone formerly to men to know what ſervice they would command me, but now I bow my ſelf to thy moſt holy pleaſure, Lord, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Speak Lord, and give me what commands thou pleaſeſt, and I am ready through thy grace to comply with them; Make and propound
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:175722:108"/>thy own terms, I will ſubmit to them. A man may have great natural light, and acquired knowledge in Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in Tongues and Languages, and theſe are ſo far from cauſing his heart to ſubmit to Chriſts will, that he will be ready to ſtand upon his own Terms. But if it be from heaven, it will cauſe a man to ſtrike ſail to Chriſt abſolutely and preſently, as we ſee here in <hi>Saul.</hi> Are we able to ſay, <hi>Speak Lord for thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hear.</hi> Write thy own terms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thy pleaſure what thou wilt have us to do or ſuffer, our wills and intereſts are ſwallowed up in thine. We will no longer be our own, to do the wills of the fleſh and of the mind, or to be captives to Satan at his will, but we would be melted into thy holy will, and improve our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtrength and deſigns for thy ſervice; This is a light darted into thy Soul from heaven, this is a ſure evidence it is Chriſt that is thy ſaving light, when it thus makes thee humble before him, inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after him, and ſubmitting thy ſelf unto him.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt the true ſaving light is warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlivening; Such is the Sun to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:175722:108"/>the earth; It heats and quickens the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Such is the Lord Chriſt to the Church, to the hearts of thoſe that are his indeed. The Lord God is a Sun, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.) which ſeveral expound of Chriſt. It is he alone that heats our Chill Spirits. He quickens thoſe dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.) But now becauſe there are falſe heats, ſome will yet enquire how we may know the heat and quickening we have to be from Chriſt? For anſwer briefly.
<list>
                     <item>(1.) If it be a heat from the Lord, it will warm us throughout, inwardly as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Artificial heat is only external; but this heats within and without, it warms every part as well as any one. <hi>The fire within me burſt out,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3.) It made <hi>Paul</hi> truly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for God. It made the diſciplies hearts to burn within them, (<hi>Luke</hi> 24.32.) The Ark was pitched within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. This heat Chriſt gives will make us not only abſtain from ſin our of reſpect to men and our credit with them, but to abhor and hate every falſe way out of a deep reſpect to God. The Sun warms every part of the body; God and Chriſt can pierce deeper than the Sun.</item>
                     <item>(2.) This
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:175722:109"/>true light warms intenſely as well as throughly. I mean, it heats more and more unto perfection: It makes us fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, boiling hot in Spirit, not like <hi>Jehu,</hi> zealous only in pretence, and growing colder as his own ends were attained, but ſtill preſſing more and more after the mark; ſtill more of God, more of Chriſt. The heart was never ſo much for ſin and ſelf, but now it is as intenſe upon God.</item>
                     <item>(3.) If the light we have, and the heat and quickening from it be from Chriſt, then it is communicative. The Sun communicates his light and heat, his beams and luſtre to others; ſo it will be here. A man will not be all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There is no Miniſter truly enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by the Lord, but he will ſay, O that all my people were ſavingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and quickned by Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Come, let us go up to the houſe of the Lord, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</hi> There is no Chriſtian thus wrought upon but will be ready to ſay as the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did, (<hi>John</hi> 4.29) <hi>Come ſee a man that told me all that ever I did.</hi> Or as <hi>David, Come, and I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my Soul.</hi> Thus as the Sun brings the creatures it produceth
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:175722:109"/>to their perfection, ſo doth Chriſt much more finiſh his good work he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to its perfect growth and maturity. This is the light and heat of the Lord.</item>
                     <item>(4.) If it be attractive and drawing, lifting up the affections, and drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the corruptions of the heart, it is from Chriſt.</item>
                  </list> The light and heat of the Sun doth attract and elevate the vapours and fogs from the earth. So Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs doth,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) Draw up the affections of Souls to himſelf. <hi>When I am lifted up,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will draw all men unto me,</hi> (John 12.32.) <hi>No man can come to me, except the father draw him,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, (<hi>John</hi> 6.44.) <hi>Draw us,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>we will run after thee,</hi> (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4.) He will draw up our love, our joy and our deſires unto him, our ſorrow, our hatred and all our affections. We ſhall love as he loves, and grieve where he grieves, and hate what he hates, and joy in what he rejoiceth in. He carries away our hearts from whatever was the unlawful object of our love, and makes us willing in the day of his power, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.)</item>
                     <item>(2.) He draws away our corruptions by the forcible heats of his holy Spirit.</item>
                  </list> There will ſoon be ſome
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:175722:110"/>ſhowers of ſorrow and grief, that we ſhould ſo much and ſo long ſin againſt the Lord, ſo loving and ſo good a Father. It will make our ſouls die to ſin daily, and to be careful and jealous leſt any affection ſhould prove inordinate and prejudicial to Chriſts honour, and its own comfort. By theſe things we may know whether Chriſt be indeed a ſaving light unto our Souls, and ſo finding him to be, may drink in all the comfort that flows from ſo ſweet a truth as this is.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>We fear,</hi> may ſome ſay, <hi>Chriſt is not ſuch a light to us, becauſe we find our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſo ſtrong in us, and our affections ſo dead to Chriſt?</hi>

Where the Apoſtle ſhews, that a written Revelation from the Word, is more ſure than an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation from heaven. Here I might ſhew ſome of thoſe Truths the Goſpel gives a more full and clear diſcovery of, than ever was before this glorious light came into the World. As the great Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Incarnation of Chriſt; the great and dangerous evil of unbelief, that Chriſt came and put himſelf in the place of ſinners, and died an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death to ſave men from unbelief; ſo that by his mediatory ſacrifice there is a poſſibility for condemned unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to be ſaved from that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is gone out againſt them; He ordered Repentance and Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins to be preached in his name; And that he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhall be ſaved. And he ſtayed not till men ſent to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:175722:113"/>him, but he calls to them, (<hi>Ezek. c.</hi> 18.) <hi>Why will ye dye, O houſe of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?—Yea, The Goſpel holds forth life to the greateſt ſinners, to the worſt or men, if thy will indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and turn in to God by Chriſt: <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotton Son,</hi> (John 3.16.) <hi>That whoſoever believeth on him,</hi> (None ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted where Chriſt is offered, but thoſe that except themſelves) <hi>ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> Yea, the Goſpel ſhews the way whereby men may be juſtified from thoſe things from which they cannot be Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> namely, by the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt imputed by God to thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and apply the ſame by true faith, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to he found, not in his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in that righteouſneſs which is through Chriſt, the righteouſneſs, which is of God, by faith. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.) He ſpeaks of the righteouſneſs of God which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe. Yea, life and immortality is brought to light by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:175722:113"/>the Goſpel, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.) Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely under the Law, more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Goſpel are theſe things revealed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is a walking, or coming forth unto the light; as if Chriſt had ſaid, Come forth that ye may ſee the light, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9.) Chriſt is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be given for a covenant of the people, that he may ſay to the Priſoners, <hi>Go forth and to them that are in darkneſs, Shew your ſelves.</hi> God the Father ſpeaks to Chriſt, in the verſe before. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will give thee for a Covenant to the people, that he may ſay to the Gentiles, go forth:</hi> That he might with power and efficacy ſay thus to them, as he did at the firſt beginning of all things ſay, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> To the Priſoners, that is, to the Gentiles who are held faſt by the cords, and in the fetters of ſin in Satans Priſon. Come
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:175722:114"/>forth to the light; Receive Divine illumination: Come forth that ye may ſee your ſelves, your loſt, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, undone condition by nature, before it be too late to get help and recovery. It's ſaid, (<hi>John</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds be reproved. Ahab</hi> hateth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiah</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> and took them for his enemies, becauſe they diſcoverd his ſins. Men love darkneſs rather than light, not only becauſe they are unwilling others ſhould ſee their ſins, but becauſe they are not willing to ſee them themſelves; But if we will liſten to Chriſt, we muſt come forth to the light, and he that doth and would ever do truth, cometh to the light, that it may be made manifeſt that his works are wrought in God, as it is, <hi>verſe</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a walking into the light. This is that Chriſt ſpeaks of in the verſe after the Text; <hi>Believe in the light, that ye may be children of light:</hi> And ſo the ſenſe is, Believe in me who am the light. And in <hi>v.</hi> 46. Chriſt adds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:175722:114"/>to clear this; <hi>I am come a light into the World, that whoſoever believeth in me, ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi> So then when the Spirit of Chriſt works faith in our Souls, we are united to Chriſt, ingrafted into him by theſe bleſſed bonds of union: His Spirit dwelleth in us, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dwelleth in our hearts by faith; when we thus receive Chriſt Jeſus the Lord by believing in his name, we walk into the light indeed, (<hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6.) When we accept him upon the terms of the Goſpel, in all his Offices, Natures, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Commands, and continue in them, we obey that which is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Walk up to the Light: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the light. <hi>I am the light of the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, (<hi>John</hi> 8.12.) <hi>He that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but have the light of life.</hi> Some ſpeak much of following the light within them, and it is indeed the duty of all to walk up to the light they have received. They that have only the light of Reaſon, that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:175722:115"/>of the Lord, ſhould walk up to to that light; And to what of God they that are Heathens have, or may know by the works of Creation: And ſo they that have the light of the Scriptures, ought to obey the ſame, and follow the Rules thereof. And ſo where the light of grace is, there is expected an anſwerable living up to the ſame. <hi>If we thus walkin the light, as God is in the light, we have fellowſhip with him, and the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6.)

A ſpot is eaſily ſeen in a Sun beam; we ſhould walk without rebuke, blamleſs, harmleſs, without ſpots, as much as may be; ſpot not our conſciences, nor our converſations, but be undefiled in the way, and keep our ſelves unſpotted from the World: To abſtain from not only apparent evil, but the very appearance of evil. <hi>Quicquid male coloratum eſt;</hi> All that hath the ſhew and colour of evil, <hi>As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e that hath called us is holy, ſo let us be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. It is to walk knowingly, in the light of Spiritual Judgment and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The Apoſtle requires Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to dwell with their Wives as men of knowledge, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.) So ought all Chriſtians to walk as thoſe that know the evil of ſin, to hate and avoid it: As thoſe that know Satans wiles and devices, to ſhun and flee from them: As thoſe that know the vanity of the World, to be dead and crucified to it by the death of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.) As thoſe that have ſeen the beauty of Chriſt, and taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his love, to be enamoured with
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:175722:118"/>him, and to cleave in love to him who loved them firſt. In a word, if they know any thing of his will, to be found doing it, that they may be bleſſed in their deed.</item>
                  <item>5. It is to walk cheerfully, in the light of Joy. Thoſe Chriſtians that ſpend their daies in ſadneſs, bring an evil report upon Gods good waies, and diſhearten and diſcourage many, who who will look upon Gods waies as things that tend to deſtroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their lives. God loves a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful giver, and a holy cheerful liver. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſinful frothy mirth; the Joy of the Lord is your ſtrength. Sometimes indeed ſin is as a Thief in the Candle that does waſt a Chriſtians Joy, and dim his comfort, which yet if truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, may be recovered, and made to ſhine more bright. But let a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever keep off from avoidable ſins, and live in the exerciſe of faith, and he may rejoyce with Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of glory, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers intermeddle not with this Joy. This is to walk in the light, when we walk unto the light, into the light, and up to the light.</item>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let me urge this exhortion of Chriſt upon you all, and upon my ſelf. Let us walk while we have the light. Some ſit ſtill idle all the day of the Goſpel; Others walk in contrary waies, but whatever others do, let us be found in obedience to this command of Chriſt. Conſider to help us herein;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the end why we have the light. We give our ſervants light to work by, not to play by. No more does God give the glorious light of the Goſpel to men to dally and trifle with, but to work out their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we thus walk as hath been ſhewn, we ſhall have cauſe to rejoyce that ever we had this bleſſed light. The Pſalmiſt praiſes God for the great lights ſet up in the viſible Heavens, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.7, 8, 9.) <hi>The Sun to Rule by day, and the Moon and Stars by night.</hi> But what praiſe ſhall we be bound to give unto God for Chriſt and the Goſpel of Chriſt, if while it ſhineth among us, we do as men do when the Sun
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:175722:119"/>ariſeth? What is that? The Pſalmiſt tells us, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.22, 23.) <hi>Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth to his work and to his labour until the evening.</hi> This Sun of Goſpel light is given us, not that we ſhould play away our Souls into deſtruction by carnal ſecurity, but to get eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The light will not alwaies ſhine, but darkneſs will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Hence the Lord in the Text uſeth this Argument; <hi>Yet a little while the light is with you, walk while ye have the light, leſt darkneſs come upon you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The darkneſs of Goſpel-removal. The longeſt day hath a night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; We have injoyed the Goſpel-light many years, and the brighter the day hath been, and yet abuſed, it may end in dreadful darkneſs. Chriſt threatned <hi>Epheſus</hi> for the loſs of her firſt love and works, to come to her quickly, and remove her Candleſtick (&amp; the Candle conſequently) except ſhe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:175722:119"/>repented, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5.) And doth not he ſeem to ſpeak the ſame to <hi>England,</hi> and to his Churches here at this day O let us yet in this our day know the things that belong unto our peace, before they be hidden from our eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The darkneſs of death, (<hi>Eccel.</hi> 12.2.) While the Sun, or the light, or the Moon, or the Stars be not dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the Earth as it was,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Before the outward parts of the body, or the inward parts of the mind decay by old age, the forerunners of death, and death it ſelf overtake us. We are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to do our work while it is day, and that with our might, (<hi>Eccle.</hi> 9.10.) <hi>For there is no work in the grave whither we go.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, (<hi>John</hi> 9.4. <hi>verſe.</hi>) <hi>The night cometh when no man can work.</hi> Now if we are going, and the night coming, how greatly doth it concern us all, to day, even while it is called to day, to work for God, and for our Souls with all our might, whatever he has put into our hand to do.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:175722:120"/>
               <p n="3">3. The darkneſs of Hell, that black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs which is for ever, (<hi>Jude</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi>) The Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are above others caſt into utter darkneſs, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12.) Let me end all with that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 16.) And O that the Lord would cauſe it to take ſome good effect upon us. <hi>Give glory to the Lord your God before he cauſe darkneſs, before your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the Shadow of death, and make it groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
